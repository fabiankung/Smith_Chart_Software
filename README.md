Written in Visual Basic .NET.

1. Create a new Visual Basic Windows Application project in Visual Studio (Version 2013 onwards).
2. Add all the *.vb (visual basic code files) and *.resx (resource files) into the project.
3. Build the project.
4. Alternatively the pre-compile *.exe file is also included, which you can use immediately, for Windows 7 and above.  Just copy to the harddisk and it should be able to run immediately.
